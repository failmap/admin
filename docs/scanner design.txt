Scanner overview:

We might need a port scanner: now we try anything on any scanner. Result is a lot of is_dead
endpoints because the port is not open. It also costs a lot of time to scan the non existing stuff.
Yet, we can not really rely on a normal port scanner, since there are many devices that either
act like the port is closed or any other port is open.
