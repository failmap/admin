screenshots and such.

The test-dataset exports 20 organizations, with their minimal information such as scans. Log info
will not be attached.

== Debug Dataset ==
The debug dataset is the most complete dataset that contains all database data, which results in
several hundreds or even thousands of megabytes of yaml.
