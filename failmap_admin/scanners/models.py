class Endpoint(models.Model):
    """
    Endpoints are created using (some) scan tools but mostly harvesters.

    An endpoint is anything that exposes to the internet that can be scanned.
    It can have any protocol, also non-usual protocols. This is where it gets fuzzy.
    But there are some conventions that mediocrely implemented.

    There can be a lot of endpoints for a domain.

    example.com might result in:
    protocols: http, https, telnet
    ports: 21, 80, 443 (do expect non-standard, hidden, ports)
    ip: multiple ipv4 and ipvquit6 addresses

    There can be unlimited ip's * 65535 ports * dozens of protocol endpoints per domain.

    What's the difference between an URL and an endpoint?
    A URL is a point of investigation. We know it exists, but we don't know anything about it:
    - we don't know it's services. Maybe therefore an Endpoint should be called a service.
        but that is not really common.
    Additionally it's easier for humans to understand a "url", much more than that there are
    ports, protocols, ip-addresses and more of that.
    """

    # places the same data was stored (increase in database size). Additionally there was no
    # django way to travel between endpoints and urls, which made it impossible to main
    # database independence. Which would then result in the solution being harder to maintain.
    # Therefore we've dropped the domain field and added a foreign key to URL.
