    """
    Endpoints are created using (some) scan tools but mostly harvesters.

    An endpoint is anything that exposes to the internet that can be scanned.
    It can have any protocol, also non-usual protocols. This is where it gets fuzzy.
    But there are some conventions that mediocrely implemented.

    There can be a lot of endpoints for a domain.

    example.com might result in:
    protocols: http, https, telnet
    ports: 21, 80, 443 (do expect non-standard, hidden, ports)
    ip: multiple ipv4 and ipvquit6 addresses

    There can be unlimited ip's * 65535 ports * dozens of protocol endpoints per domain.

    What's the difference between an URL and an endpoint?
    A URL is a point of investigation. We know it exists, but we don't know anything about it:
    - we don't know it's services. Maybe therefore an Endpoint should be called a service.
        but that is not really common.
    Additionally it's easier for humans to understand a "url", much more than that there are
    ports, protocols, ip-addresses and more of that.

    At one time an endpoint can have multiple IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. They are not worth too much
    and managed quite brutally by scanners (some just deleting all of the existing ones if there is
    a new set of addresses, which is common for some service providers).

    If an IP address does indeed have a website, or other service specifically, it should be treated
    as URL, as the chance is very high this URL is as static as any other URL.
