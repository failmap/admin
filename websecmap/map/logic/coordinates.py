    Warning: Points in geojson are stored in lng,lat. Leaflet wants to show it the other way around.

    coordinates, longitude, and latitude for geographic coordinates):

    https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/54065/leaflet-geojson-coordinate-problem

    >> wouldn't call it a bug, just a matter of confusing and contradictory standards.
    >> When talking about geographic locations, we usually use Lat-long. This has been codified in the ISO 6709
        standard.
    >> When dealing with Cartesian coordinate geometry, we generally use X-Y. Many GIS systems, work with a Geographic
        Location as a special case of a 2 D coordinate point, where the X represents the longitude and Y represents
        the Latitude. This order of coordinates, is exactly opposite that of the regular Lat-long notion.
    >> Coming to your problem:

    >> The map.setView takes a l.LatLong as an input, where the first cordinate is a Latitude, and the second is
        Longitude.
    >> Hence when you want 52.23N, 4.97E, you pass in [52.23943, 4.97599]
    >> The GeoJSON standard says that for any point, the first parameter is the X Coordinate (i.e. Longitude) and
        second parameter is the Y coordinate (i.e. Latitude);
    >> Hence when you want 52.23N, 4.97E in GeoJSON, you need to pass [4.97599, 52.23943]
