    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security
    Note: The Strict-Transport-Security header is ignored by the browser when your site is accessed using HTTP;
    this is because an attacker may intercept HTTP connections and inject the header or remove it.  When your
    site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows your site is HTTPS capable and will
    honor the Strict-Transport-Security header.

    7 march 2018
    After a series of complaints of products designed specifically to run on port 443 (without any non-secured port)
    we've decided that HSTS is only required if there are no unsecured (http) endpoints on this url.
    This means: if you still run (another) service on an unsecured http port, we're still demanding hsts. We're not
    able to see what product runs on what port (and it should be like that).

    The HSTS header is a sloppy patch job anyway, it will be phased out after browsers require sites to run on 443 and
    just start blocking port 80 for websites alltogether. On that day preloading also goes out the window.

    It basically works like this:
    A downgrade attack is not dependent on missing hsts. It's depending on who operates the network and if they employ
    DNS cache poisoning and use sslstrip etc. Then it comes down to your browser not accepting http at all either via
    preloading or the HSTS header (or design). The user may also trust your injected certificate given HPKP is removed
    everywhere and users will certainly click OK if they can.

    If you think it works differently, just file an issue or make a pull request. We want to get it right.

    Issue #94:
    TL;DR: The fix is to follow all redirects.

    Citing: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22077618/respect-x-frame-options-with-http-redirect
    Source: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034
    Thanks to: antoinet.

    From the terminology used in RFC 7034,

    The use of "X-Frame-Options" allows a web page from host B to declare that its content (for example, a
    button, links, text, etc.) must not be displayed in a frame (<frame> or <iframe>) of another page (e.g.,
    from host A). This is done by a policy declared in the HTTP header and enforced by browser implementations
    as documented here.

    The X-Frame-Options HTTP header field indicates a policy that specifies whether the browser should render
    the transmitted resource within a <frame> or an <iframe>. Servers can declare this policy in the header of
    their HTTP responses to prevent clickjacking attacks, which ensures that their content is not embedded
    into other pages or frames.


    Similarly, since a redirect is a flag not to render the content, the content can't be manipulated.
    This also means no X-XSS-Protection or X-Content-Type-Options are needed. So just follow all redirects.

    Update 17 dec 2018: some web servers require a user agent to be sent in order to give a "more correct" response.
    Given that 'humans with browsers' access these pages, it's normal to also send a user agent.
